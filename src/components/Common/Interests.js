              Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
              indoors. Usually I like listening to hip-hip and j-pop songs, When
              not listening to songs I usually play games with my friends. I
              also follow sports news such as football and baseball.

            <p class="mb-0">
              When forced outdoors, I prefer to hang out with my friends.
